# Future Work

This repository contains a version 1.0 of the Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) process and practices. We plan to further enhance and improve the project.

This list represents current ideas how to further improve the initiative:

 * Extensions to (Domain-driven) practices for steps 4-6.
 * Apply process in real projects to validate and improve it.
   * This might lead to new patterns, practices and improvements to the process.
 * Open up process and practices to management and strategic/business level.
 * Monitoring of ethical issues in the long run.
   * Many problems might only reveal themselves after years of productive experience wih a system.
