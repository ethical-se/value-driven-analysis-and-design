# Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) 
[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

_TL;DR:_ Technology should support humanity and avoid harming people and their values; we want to help engineers and technology creators create solutions that promote positive values and aim to reduce harm to our society and people. The Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) process aims to combine value-driven approaches with state-of-the-art software engineering practices such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## Motivation and Vision

Digitalized solutions generally try to optimize all kinds of processes, make people's work easier and achieve economic goals. While economic values already receive a lot of attention, it is often forgotten that digitalizing our world "wherever we can" has potentially negative effects on human values as well.

The goal of this work is to enable all types of stakeholders in software-intensive projects to respect human/ethical values equally with economic and technical requirements throughout the life cycle of a project. 

We aim to achieve this by providing:

 1. Lean and "audience-centric" processes and novel work practices.
 2. Knowledge structures, notation suggestions, and concrete examples.
 3. Recommendations for appropriate tools that support the suggested work practices.

VDAD targets all roles and individuals engaged in digitalization projects. Every company or team engaged in the development of digital solutions has an influence on human beings, society, and our values. Technology creators who aspire to craft software and digital products that is both valuable and free from harm to humanity are invited to apply VDAD practices in their projects.

The [user stories](user-stories.md) page outlines the target audience of VDAD with concrete, exemplary user stories.

If you are interested in applying our practices in your projects, please [contact us](https://www.ost.ch/de/person/stefan-kapferer-2046). We are always happy to consult and/or collaborate on industry/research projects to see our ideas applied in the "real world" and to improve them based on the feedback collected.

## Repository Content

Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) describes an **iterative process** consisting of seven steps. Each step is described on a separate page and links to practices (activities and artifacts) along the process:

 * [Process Overview](./process/README.md)
   * [Domain-Driven Practices and Collaborative Modelling as Enabler for Value-Based Engineering](./process/README.md#domain-driven-practices-and-collaborative-modelling-as-enabler-for-value-based-engineering)
   * [Overview of Practices and Tools](./process/README.md#overview-of-practices-and-tools)
 * [Step 1: Aquire Domain Understanding](./process/step-1-aquire-domain-understanding.md)
 * [Step 2: Identify Stakeholders](./process/step-2-identify-stakeholders.md)
 * [Step 3: Identify Values per Stakeholder](./process/step-3-identify-values-per-stakeholder.md)
 * [Step 4: Prioritize Values](./process/step-4-prioritize-values.md)
 * [Step 5: Make Digitalization Decision](./process/step-5-make-digitalization-decision.md)
 * [Step 6: Derive New and Adjust Existing Requirements](./process/step-6-derive-new-and-adjust-existing-requirements.md)
 * [Step 7: Design Software Architecture](./process/step-7-design-software-architecture.md)
 * [Process Continuation (Iterative Approach)](./process/step-infinity-process-continuation.md)

The [practices](./practices/README.md) folder contains the **practices supporting the VDAD process**: 

 * [Stakeholder Modeling](./practices/stakeholder-mapping.md)
 * [Value Impact Mapping](./practices/value-impact-mapping.md)

**Additional files**:

 * [User Stories](user-stories.md) that describe exemplary VDAD application scenarios.
 * Selected [Tools](tools.md) that support the VDAD process and our project.
 * [Project Background and Related Work](related-work.md)
 * [Glossary](glossary.md)
