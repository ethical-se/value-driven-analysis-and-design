# Project Background and Related Work

The Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) process and this repository have been crafted as part of the project «Just Enough Digitalization» at [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (OST)](https://www.ost.ch). Please contact [Stefan Kapferer](https://www.ost.ch/de/person/stefan-kapferer-2046) to get in touch with us.
