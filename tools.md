# VDAD Tool Support

As suggested throughout the [seven VDAD steps](./process/README.md), many general-purpose visual tools exist that can support the process, for instance, online whiteboards. 

However, there are not many that support modeling based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)[^1] patterns (strategic and tactical DDD), as well as stakeholder and value modeling, all in one tool. Therefore, we would like to point out our open source tool [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org), which supports many VDAD steps with its Context Mapping Language (CML) and generators that automatically create [Stakeholder Maps](./practices/stakeholder-mapping.md) and [Value Impact Maps](./practices/value-impact-mapping.md). Check it out [here](https://contextmapper.org/docs/vdad-support).
