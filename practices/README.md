# VDAD Practices

This folder contains all new (suggested by us) or adjusted (existing) practices supporting the VDAD process. Currently, there are two:

 * [Stakeholder Mapping](stakeholder-mapping.md) (documented for the specific use case; not a new practice)
 * [Value Impact Mapping (VIM)](value-impact-mapping.md)

For all other existing practices that support the VDAD process, we refer to the [practices table in the process overview page](./../process/README.md#overview-of-practices-and-tools).

For tools that support and ease the application of our practices, please check the [tools page](./../tools.md).
